                <h2>What Are Microgreens?</h2>
                <p>Microgreens are edible seedlings of vegetables and herbs, harvested shortly after the first true leaves (cotyledons) have fully developed. They represent a unique "superfood" stage of plant growth—capturing plants at their peak nutrient density, right before anti-nutrients begin to form.</p>
                <p>Unlike sprouts (which are germinated seeds eaten whole, including roots), microgreens are cut just above the soil line and consist only of the stem and tender young leaves. This makes them safer, more flavorful, and more versatile in culinary applications.</p>
                <p>Common microgreen varieties include sunflower, broccoli, radish, pea shoots, basil, kale, arugula, and many more. Each offers distinct flavors, colors, and nutritional profiles.</p>

                <h2>The Science Behind the Superfood</h2>
                <p>Microgreens are considered a "superfood stage" because research shows they retain exceptionally high levels of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants during early growth. As plants mature, they often produce anti-nutrients (compounds that inhibit nutrient absorption), but microgreens are harvested before this occurs.</p>
                <p>Studies have documented that microgreens can contain up to <strong>40 times more nutrients</strong> than their mature counterparts. For instance:</p>
                <ul class="science-list">
                    <li>Red cabbage microgreens have <strong>40× more Vitamin E</strong> than mature cabbage.</li>
                    <li>Broccoli microgreens contain extremely high levels of <strong>sulforaphane</strong>, a compound linked to cancer prevention and detoxification.</li>
                    <li>Radish microgreens are packed with <strong>vitamin C and antioxidants</strong> that support immune health.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This makes microgreens an ideal ingredient for health-conscious consumers, wellness-focused businesses, and anyone looking to maximize nutrition in every bite.</p>

                    <h3>Storage Tips</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Keep microgreens refrigerated at 2–4°C (36–39°F).</li>
                        <li>Store in their original compostable packaging or transfer to an airtight container lined with a damp paper towel.</li>
                        <li>Consume within 5–7 days for optimal freshness and nutrition.</li>
                        <li>Do not wash until ready to use—excess moisture can cause wilting.</li>
                    </ul>
