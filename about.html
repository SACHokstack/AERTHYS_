                <h2>Our Founder's Story</h2>
                <p>Aerthys was born from a deep connection to the land and a vision for sustainable agriculture. Our founder, Theivanth Rajamohan, spent his childhood at his grandmother's village farm, where he learned the rhythms of nature and the value of working with the earth.</p>
                <p>Years later, while studying at Singapore Management University, Theivanth participated in a sustainability program that rekindled his passion for agriculture. He recognized the urgent need for farming practices that nourish both people and the planet. This realization led him to specialize in sustainable agriculture and ultimately to establish Aerthys.</p>
                <p>Theivanth set out with a clear mission: to grow pesticide-free microgreens that promote consumer well-being while minimizing environmental impact. Today, Aerthys operates from rooftop farms in Coimbatore, bringing ultra-fresh, nutrient-dense greens to local restaurants, hotels, and wellness businesses.</p>

                <h2>Our Sustainability Focus</h2>
                <p>At Aerthys, sustainability isn't just a buzzword—it's the foundation of everything we do. Our farming practices are designed to work with nature, conserve resources, and support local communities.</p>

                    <div class="sustainability-card">
                        <h3>💧 Water Conservation</h3>
                        <p>Microgreens use up to 90% less water than conventional farming. Our controlled growing systems maximize efficiency, ensuring every drop counts.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="sustainability-card">
                        <h3>🌍 Reduced Carbon Footprint</h3>
                        <p>By producing food near the city, urban farms directly reduce carbon emissions since crops travel far shorter distances. Our hyper-local model means your greens go from harvest to your kitchen in hours, not days.</p>
